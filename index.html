  <h1>About Project</h1>

<!--   <p>Second-order impacts of COVID-19 will transform society and economies. The C2M2 project builds on global networks of geospatial experts to analyze second-order impacts of COVID-19. These include long-term effects on informal economies, changing patterns of mobility, and access to basic services.</p> -->

  <p>Reports estimate that the disastrous effects of COVID-19 will severely affect over 5 million people in Dhaka city only. Substantial numbers of people will have very limited livelihood options, and will face increased vulnerability to food insecurity, heightened debt exposure and spiking cost of living. Before the pandemic, Dhaka faced a big problem of mass influx of people, due to its employment opportunities. Now, Bangladesh’s problem is quite the opposite. Millions of these internal migrants have (and are expected) to leave Dhaka and go back to their places. Considering the situation, the project aims to explore the secondary socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 in an urban setting specially targeting low- and middle-income people and how it is influencing people to migrate? It is explorative in nature mostly focuses on map-based analysis with a limited focus on statistical analysis.</p>
