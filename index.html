  <h1>About Project</h1>

<!--   <p>Second-order impacts of COVID-19 will transform society and economies. The C2M2 project builds on global networks of geospatial experts to analyze second-order impacts of COVID-19. These include long-term effects on informal economies, changing patterns of mobility, and access to basic services.</p> -->

  <p style="text-align: justify">Reports estimate that the disastrous effects of COVID-19 will severely affect over 5 million people in Dhaka city only. Substantial numbers of people will have very limited livelihood options, and will face increased vulnerability to food insecurity, heightened debt exposure and spiking cost of living. Before the pandemic, Dhaka faced a big problem of mass influx of people, due to its employment opportunities. Now, Bangladesh’s problem is quite the opposite. Millions of these internal migrants have (and are expected) to leave Dhaka and go back to their places. Considering the situation, the project aims to explore the secondary socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 in an urban setting specially targeting low- and middle-income people and how it is influencing people to migrate? It is explorative in nature mostly focuses on map-based analysis with a limited focus on statistical analysis.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">
    This project aims to support local authorities, leaders and policy-makers -- especially those in cities and other urban settlements -- in identifying the effective approaches to plan for and mitigate the effects of COVID-19-induced internal migration out of Dhaka. To that effect, we will</p> 
(i) collect data on the migrants and the existing physical infrastructures in the focused areas, 
(ii) develop and share analysis products to the concerned stakeholders, and 
(iii) constantly engage the stakeholders throughout the project. 
<p style="text-align: justify">Considering the situation, this project will conduct an explorative study to gather secondary as well as primary (wherever necessary) datasets on the background factors which are forcing these people to migrate. This study focuses on outlining the causal factors of outbound migration and also seeks possible solution mechanisms afterwards: which will be assistive in delaminating policy framework limitations.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify">We expect the resultant data and products will be taken into consideration while determining urban vulnerabilities and devising strategies to enhance the prevention, preparedness and readiness for secondary impact of COVID-19. The overarching goal of this project is to facilitate a robust response and eventual recovery from the pandemic’s secondary impact in Bangladesh.
